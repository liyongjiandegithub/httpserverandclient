Functional changes between in version 0.2.5 versus version 0.2.3
Date: Feb/12/2010
Note: version 2.5 merges changes in internal release 2.4 with released version version 2.3.

==============================================================================================
Httpmcli.c - Added HTTP_ManagedClientRequestExExperimental() function. This is used by the
SOAP POST commands. HTTP_ManagedClientRequestEx() is still used for other UPnP client
requests. The HTTP_ManagedClientRequestEx() does not properly include all fields in the content length
because those fileds are appended after it is called. This caused a at least one stack to reject
post meessages.
httpsrv.c
    Corrected error in processing http version numbers..
    Changed:
   if (request->httpMajorVersion >= 1 && request->httpMinorVersion >= 0)
   To:
   if (request->httpMajorVersion > 1 || (request->httpMajorVersion == 1 && request->httpMinorVersion >= 1))

   #define UPPERCASE(X) (((X) >= 'a' && (X) <= 'z')? ((X) + 'A' - 'a') : (X))

2. In file fileext.c
   At line 138, inserted defination for .wmv file type
